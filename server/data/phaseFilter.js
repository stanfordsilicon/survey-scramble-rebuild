// with no cached result yet plays completely unfiltered, exactly as it did

// the default one every production deploy hits until someone remembers to
// set the env var. Local dev that wants its own local qmoji-2 still just
// sets QMOJI_ADMIN_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5500 to override this.

// unfiltered, and only requests after the instance had been warm for a
// moment actually restricted to the real Phase set. That's "eventually
// correct," not "correct," for anyone whose very first round happens to
// land on a cold start -- which on a lightly-used deployment is not a rare
